## Overview

Welcome to **The Wild Oasis**! This is the **customer-facing version** of a hotel management web app where users can:

- View and browse available cabins with images and descriptions.
- Book cabins based on availability and select the number of guests.
- Sign in with Google to manage bookings.
- View, edit, or cancel existing bookings.
- Update profile information.
- Enjoy a fully responsive experience on all devices.

I also built an **admin version** for hotel staff to manage cabins, bookings, and guests.
